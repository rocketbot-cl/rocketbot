Pyshortcuts helps developers and Python users to create shortcuts on a
Users Desktop or Start Menu that will run python scripts and applications.

Pyshortcuts is cross-platform, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux each in
the way most natural for the OS.  On Windows, a Shortcut or Link is
created.  On Linux a ".desktop" file is created.  On MacOS, a minimal
Application is created.  In all cases, the shortcuts are put either
directly on the Desktop or Start Menu , or in a folder on the Desktop or
Start Menu of the current user.  That means that there is not need for
elevated permission or writing to system-level files (registry,
/Applications, /usr/bin).  The user has complete control to rename, move,
or delete the shortcut after it is created.  Shortcuts can have a custom
icon (`.ico` files on Windows or Linux, or `.icns` files on MacOS)
specified, defaulting to a Python icon included with the pyshortcuts
module.

Pyshortcuts is pure python, has a small footprint and is very easy to
install and use either from a python script.  That is to say, it can easily
be part of a installation (or post-installation process) process for larger
packages.
